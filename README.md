# Lets-Travel
Third project I had to replicate for the Udemy course.

Visually it's simple and it was created very fast because it's made with Bootstrap, which has a lot of code available on its website, but it's also a much more advanced website in terms of functionality since it has an image slider (called Carousel in Bootstrap) with 3 images that has indicators and controls and a modal that opens when you click the 'Contact Us' button at the bottom right of the page.
