# Lets-Travel
Third project I had to replicate for the Udemy course i'm making.

Visually it's simple and it was made very fast because it's made with Bootstrap and it has a lot of code available on Bootstrap's website, but it's also a much more advanced website in terms of functionality since it has an image slider (called Carousel in Bootstrap) with 3 images that has indicators and controls. 

This page also has a modal that opens when you click the 'Contact Us' button at the bottom right of the page.
